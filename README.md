This repository consists of materials that are used
in [Datacamp 2020](http://datacamp.boun.edu.tr/) workshop
 at [Bogazici University](http://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index). You can find resources below for further research.


## Requirements

- [QGIS 3.10 Long-Term Stable](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
- [Google Earth Engine Registration](https://code.earthengine.google.com/)

## Resources

### Open GIS Platforms
- [Osgeo](https://www.osgeo.org/initiatives/open-geoscience/) - Open Geoscience platform where many applications are published and maintained.
- [Opengeohub](https://www.opengeohub.org/) - Open Hub with many educational resources.
 Pay attention to their [Summer School](https://www.youtube.com/c/OpenGeoHubFoundation/playlists) contents. You can learn many advanced topics here.
- [Spatial Ecology](http://www.spatial-ecology.net/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=start) - Detailed Geospatial & Remote Sensing computing environment tutorials
are added here. The website may seem complicated, but it is a great source for high-performance geocomputing.
### R & Python Materials
- [Spatial Datascience with R](https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.app/) - Detailed introduction to geospatial analysis in R. Chapter 2 can be
reviewed for GIS introduction, as well.
- [Python Geospatial](https://github.com/giswqs/python-geospatial) - A collection of Python packages for geospatial analysis.
- [Rgee](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee) - Binding package for calling Google Earth Engine API from within R.
- [Geemap](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap) - Great package for calling Google Earth Engine API from within Python, maintained by a great professor.
### Earth Engine
- [Official Guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides)
### Lectures
- [Summer School](https://www.youtube.com/c/OpenGeoHubFoundation/playlists) - Thorough introductions to use cases of GIS and Remote Sensing data.
